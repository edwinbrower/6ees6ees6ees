This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

If you don't have npm installed on your system, install it by running brew install node

Install Bower by running the following command npm install -g bower.

Use bower to install the client-side dependancies by running the following command from the root directory of the repo: bower install.
